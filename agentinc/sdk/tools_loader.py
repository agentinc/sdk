`load_tools()` — turn an agent's manifest into callables it can use.

An agent names the tools it wants and receives them; it never imports them.
That indirection is the whole design (ADR-0007): the same published agent runs
for two tenants against their own credentials, because what a name resolves to
is decided at run time rather than at `import` time.

Resolution is pluggable, and the two implementations differ only in where they
look:

* **local** (this module's default) — whatever tool providers are installed,
  secrets from the environment. What a developer gets on a laptop with no
  backend. Providers advertise themselves through an entry point group, so this
  SDK names no particular package.
* **platform** — the pinned digest from the registry, config and secrets from
  the tenant's installation. Supplied by the runtime, not from here.

The SDK ships only the local one. A resolver that reaches into tenant
installations belongs to the platform, and putting it here would drag the
registry across the open-source boundary.
